* INTRODUCTION

  GnuPG is a complete and free implementation of the OpenPGP standard
  as defined by RFC4880 (also known as PGP).  GnuPG enables encryption
  and signing of data and communication, and features a versatile key
  management system as well as access modules for public key
  directories.

  GnuPG, also known as GPG, is a command line tool with features for
  easy integration with other applications.  A wealth of frontend
  applications and libraries are available that make use of GnuPG.
  Starting with version 2 GnuPG provides support for S/MIME and Secure
  Shell in addition to OpenPGP.

  GnuPG is Free Software (meaning that it respects your freedom). It
  can be freely used, modified and distributed under the terms of the
  GNU General Public License.

* BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

  GnuPG 2.3 depends on the following GnuPG related packages:

    npth         (https://gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/npth/)
    libgpg-error (https://gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/libgpg-error/)
    libgcrypt    (https://gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/libgcrypt/)
    libksba      (https://gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/libksba/)
    libassuan    (https://gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/libassuan/)

  You should get the latest versions of course, the GnuPG configure
  script complains if a version is not sufficient.

  Several other standard libraries are also required.  The configure
  script prints diagnostic messages if one of these libraries is not
  available and a feature will not be available..

  You also need the Pinentry package for most functions of GnuPG;
  however it is not a build requirement.  Pinentry is available at
  https://gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/pinentry/ .

  After building and installing the above packages in the order as
  given above, you may continue with GnuPG installation (you may also
  just try to build GnuPG to see whether your already installed
  versions are sufficient).

  As with all packages, you just have to do

    ./configure
    make
    make check
    make install

  The "make check" is optional but highly recommended.  To run even
  more tests you may add "--enable-all-tests" to the configure run.
  Before running the "make install" you might need to become root.

  If everything succeeds, you have a working GnuPG with support for
  OpenPGP, S/MIME, ssh-agent, and smartcards.

  In case of problem please ask on the gnupg-users@gnupg.org mailing
  list for advise.

  Instruction on how to build for Windows can be found in the file
  doc/HACKING in the section "How to build an installer for Windows".
  This requires some experience as developer.

  You may run

    gpgconf --list-dirs

  to view the directories used by GnuPG.

  To quickly build all required software without installing it, the
  Speedo method may be used:

    make -f build-aux/speedo.mk  native

  This method downloads all required libraries and does a native build
  of GnuPG to PLAY/inst/.  GNU make is required and you need to set
  LD_LIBRARY_PATH to $(pwd)/PLAY/inst/lib to test the binaries.

** Specific build problems on some machines:

*** Apple OSX 10.x using XCode

  On some versions the correct location of a header file can't be
  detected by configure.  To fix that you should run configure like
  this

    ./configure  gl_cv_absolute_stdint_h=/usr/include/stdint.h

  Add other options as needed.


*** Systems without a full C99 compiler

  If you run into problems with your compiler complaining about dns.c
  you may use

    ./configure --disable-libdns

  Add other options as needed.



* RECOMMENDATIONS

** Socket directory

  GnuPG uses Unix domain sockets to connect its components (on Windows
  an emulation of these sockets is used).  Depending on the type of
  the file system, it is sometimes not possible to use the GnuPG home
  directory (i.e. ~/.gnupg) as the location for the sockets.  To solve
  this problem GnuPG prefers the use of a per-user directory below the
  the /run (or /var/run) hierarchy for the sockets.  It is thus
  suggested to create per-user directories on system or session
  startup.  For example, the following snippet can be used in
  /etc/rc.local to create these directories:

      [ ! -d /run/user ] && mkdir /run/user
      awk -F: </etc/passwd '$3 >= 1000 && $3 < 65000 {print $3}' \
        | ( while read uid rest; do
              if [ ! -d "/run/user/$uid" ]; then
                mkdir /run/user/$uid
                chown $uid /run/user/$uid
                chmod 700 /run/user/$uid
              fi
            done )


* DOCUMENTATION

  The complete documentation is in the texinfo manual named
  `gnupg.info'.  Run "info gnupg" to read it.  If you want a a
  printable copy of the manual, change to the "doc" directory and
  enter "make pdf" For a HTML version enter "make html" and point your
  browser to gnupg.html/index.html.  Standard man pages for all
  components are provided as well.  An online version of the manual is
  available at [[https://gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gnupg/]] .  A
  version of the manual pertaining to the current development snapshot
  is at [[https://gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gnupg-devel/]] .


* Using the legacy version GnuPG 1.4

  The 1.4 version of GnuPG is only intended to allow decryption of old
  data material using legacy keys which are not anymore supported by
  GnuPG 2.x.  To install both versions alongside, it is suggested to
  rename the 1.4 version of "gpg" to "gpg1" as well as the
  corresponding man page.  Newer releases of the 1.4 branch will
  likely do this by default.


* HOW TO GET MORE INFORMATION

  A description of new features and changes since version 2.1 can be
  found in the file "doc/whats-new-in-2.1.txt" and online at
  "https://gnupg.org/faq/whats-new-in-2.1.html" .

  The primary WWW page is "https://gnupg.org"
  The primary FTP site is "https://gnupg.org/ftp/gcrypt/"

  See [[https://gnupg.org/download/mirrors.html]] for a list of
  mirrors and use them if possible.  You may also find GnuPG mirrored
  on some of the regular GNU mirrors.

  We have some mailing lists dedicated to GnuPG:

     gnupg-announce@gnupg.org   For important announcements like new
                                versions and such stuff.  This is a
                                moderated list and has very low traffic.
                                Do not post to this list.

     gnupg-users@gnupg.org      For general user discussion and
                                help (English).

     gnupg-de@gnupg.org         German speaking counterpart of
                                gnupg-users.

     gnupg-ru@gnupg.org         Russian speaking counterpart of
                                gnupg-users.

     gnupg-devel@gnupg.org      GnuPG developers main forum.

  You subscribe to one of the list by sending mail with a subject of
  "subscribe" to x-request@gnupg.org, where x is the name of the
  mailing list (gnupg-announce, gnupg-users, etc.). See
  https://gnupg.org/documentation/mailing-lists.html for archives
  of the mailing lists.

  Please direct bug reports to [[https://bugs.gnupg.org]] or post them
  direct to the mailing list <gnupg-devel@gnupg.org>.

  Please direct questions about GnuPG to the users mailing list or one
  of the PGP newsgroups; please do not direct questions to one of the
  authors directly as we are busy working on improvements and bug
  fixes.  The English and German mailing lists are watched by the
  authors and we try to answer questions when time allows us.

  Commercial grade support for GnuPG is available; for a listing of
  offers see https://gnupg.org/service.html .  Maintaining and
  improving GnuPG requires a lot of time.  Since 2001, g10 Code GmbH,
  a German company owned and headed by GnuPG's principal author Werner
  Koch, is bearing the majority of these costs.  To keep GnuPG in a
  healthy state, they need your support.
